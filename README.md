# Currency

Money formatting and parsing for integer minor units. 136 currencies with correct decimal exponents — including the twenty where dividing by 100 is wrong. Zero dependencies.

## Why

Store money as an integer number of minor units, always. Floats cannot represent `0.10`, and the error compounds through every total, tax line and refund until a report is out by a penny nobody can find.

That leaves one question the integer does not answer: how many minor units are in a major one? Almost every implementation assumes 100. It is 1 for yen, and 1000 for Bahraini dinar — so ¥1000 sent as `100000` charges a hundred times too much, and BD 1.500 sent as `150` charges a tenth.

Twenty of the 136 currencies here are not two-decimal. Getting that wrong is not a rounding bug, it is a two-orders-of-magnitude billing error.

## Features

- 💰 **Integer arithmetic throughout** — no float ever touches an amount.
- 🔢 **Correct exponents** — 0 for JPY and the CFA francs, 3 for BHD, KWD, OMR, TND.
- 🏦 **Stripe's special cases** — ISK, HUF, TWD and UGX, where the API's expectation differs from the ISO exponent.
- 📉 **Minimum and maximum charge amounts** — per currency, so you can reject an uncharageable total before the gateway does.
- 🧮 **Fair allocation** — split an amount into parts with the remainder distributed, never lost.
- 🖊️ **Forgiving parsing** — `€1.234,56` and `$1,234.56` both come back as `123456`.
- 🌐 **Locale formatting** — via ext-intl when present, with a sensible fallback when not.

## Requirements

PHP 8.5+ (`ext-intl` optional, for locale-aware formatting)

## Installation

```bash
composer require sugarmill/currency
```

## Usage

```php
use SugarMill\Currency\Money;

Money::format( 4999, 'USD' );            // '$49.99'
Money::format( 1000, 'JPY' );            // '¥1,000'
Money::format( 1500, 'BHD' );            // 'BD 1.500'
Money::format_with_code( 4999, 'USD' );  // '49.99 USD'
Money::decimal( 4999, 'USD' );           // '49.99'
Money::input_value( 4999, 'USD' );       // '49.99' — no separators, for a form field
```

### Parsing

```php
Money::parse( '$1,234.56', 'USD' );   // 123456
Money::parse( '€1.234,56', 'EUR' );   // 123456
Money::parse( '1000', 'JPY' );        // 1000
Money::parse( 'nonsense', 'USD' );    // 0
```

Throws `InvalidArgumentException` for an amount too large to hold in an integer — a twenty-digit figure typed into a price field. Clamping it silently would be worse.

### Validating an amount

```php
Money::is_valid_amount( 150, 'JPY' );        // false — JPY has no minor unit
Money::round_to_valid( 150, 'JPY' );         // 150 → nearest representable
Money::is_chargeable( 20, 'USD' );           // false — under Stripe's minimum
Money::why_not_chargeable( 20, 'USD' );      // a sentence you can show the buyer
```

### Splitting

```php
Money::percentage( 4999, 20.0 );   // 1000 — VAT, rounded once
Money::allocate( 1000, 3 );        // [334, 333, 333] — remainder distributed, total preserved
```

`allocate()` is the one to reach for when splitting a discount across line items or a payout across parties. Dividing and rounding each part independently loses or invents money.

### Metadata

```php
use SugarMill\Currency\Currencies;

Currencies::decimals( 'BHD' );        // 3
Currencies::symbol( 'GBP' );          // '£'
Currencies::name( 'JPY' );            // 'Japanese Yen'
Currencies::is_zero_decimal( 'KRW' ); // true
Currencies::for_country( 'CH' );      // ['CHF']
Currencies::options();                // code => label, for a select
```

## The currencies that are not two-decimal

| Exponent | Currencies |
|---|---|
| 0 | BIF, CLP, DJF, GNF, JPY, KMF, KRW, MGA, PYG, RWF, UGX, VND, VUV, XAF, XOF, XPF |
| 3 | BHD, IQD, JOD, KWD, LYD, OMR, TND |

Four more are worth knowing about because Stripe treats them differently from ISO 4217: **ISK** and **HUF** are zero-decimal at ISO but must be sent as multiples of 100; **TWD** likewise; **UGX** is zero-decimal but historically was sent otherwise. The tables here follow what the API actually expects.

## Security

Currency codes arrive from query strings more often than people expect — `?currency=` on a headless checkout. An unrecognised code is never echoed back into formatted output; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Testing

```bash
composer install
composer test
```

93 tests, 873 assertions — every exponent verified against ISO 4217 and Stripe's published tables, plus allocation invariants (the parts always sum to the whole) and the hostile-input cases.
